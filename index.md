Over the years I have seen many "bad" Web sites. I want to have your online presence to be remembered for being a "great" site, not a "bad" one.  

Design, structured engineering, and polished layouts. I specialize in professional and interactive Web sites. From design to final roll out, I work with you one on one to make sure your site stands out, so that your visitors will want to return over and over.  

My primary focus is the development of affordable and professional Web sites that will have a long life. I have worked with many types of clients over the years, from school organizations to individuals to small businesses.  

So, feel like talking Web sites? Well, that's what I am here for! I want to know what I can do to help you achieve your goals on the Internet. Take a few minutes and check out my [philosophy](philosophy.html). If you like what you see, take another moment or two and [contact me](contact_me.html). I will be back in touch shortly.
