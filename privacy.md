### Use of cookies

We use "cookies" to identify you when you visit Pudro Design, and to build up a demographic profile. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. If you are uncomfortable with cookie technology, you have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies.

### Choice/opt-out

You may receive periodic e-mail newsletters from us. These newsletters contain information on new features and facilities of note at the Web site. Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us directly.

### Internet-based transfers

Given that the internet is a global environment, using the internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing the pudro.com site and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

The Privacy Policy Statement does not apply to Third Party Sites.

### Changes to these Terms

Pudro Design reserves the right, at its discretion, to make changes to any part of the Site. Due to its policy of updating and improving the site, Pudro Design may wish to change these Terms (including those relating to your use of the Content). When terms are changed, we will notify you by e-mail or by publishing details of those changes by including them at the end of these Terms (see "Changes to these Terms"). If you use the Site after we have published or notified you of the changes, you are agreeing now to be bound by those changes. If you do not agree to be bound by those changes, you should not use the Site any further after they are published at the end of these Terms or after you receive notice of them.

### General

You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these terms. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of that provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. Failure by either party to exercise any right or remedy under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy. Headings in these Terms are for convenience only and will have no legal meaning or effect.
